I'm Fábio and I've been leading teams for the past 5 years in the game development area - specifically - software developers.

This content is about showing tools that I've learned along my journey and that I would love to have known since my first days as a leader/manager.

I foresee that if you continue reading, at least one of the following will happen:

- You learn some new tools and add them to your toolbelt;
- You will notice that you've been using one of them successfully already, and afterwards you will do so more consciously;
- or, you won't agree with what I wrote, triggering you to keep looking for your own path down the leadership role.

Everything that's written in this blog is highly personal and portraits my own view/perspective and, above all, my own experience since I was promoted up until now.
