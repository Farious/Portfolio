# Leadership

Welcome!

I'm FÃ¡bio and I've been leading teams for the past 5 years in the game development area - software developers.

I don't know if I'm a good leader/manager and this content is not about that, its mainly about showing tools that I've learned along my journey and that I would love to know since my first days as a leader/manager.

Hopefully you will learn some new tools and add them to your toolbelt; or you will notice that you've been using one of the successfully already and after reading you will be making a more conscious decision of when to use it; or, you won't agree with something that I wrote here and will help you find your own path down this road.

## What do I consider to be leadership?

I'm going to start with something that might be polarizing - leadership/management is not about being a psychologist; profiling; 

### Management vs Leadership

The definition of [management][1] and [leadership][2] is really well defined as one can check on wikipedia.

Although this is not the case when working in a business, where both terms are used interchangeably and you might even end up putting both hats during the year.

For me, and given my experience, I like to structure it like this in my head in a ELI5 manner:

- Manager - Approves vacations and time/project allocation of individuals
- Leader - Grows and empowers individuals to be better professionals
- IC - Individual contributor, the individuals that report to you
- Line Manager - Your own leader/manager
- Team - Everyone that works directly with you and your IC's

Your current role might be more managerial or more leadership, even though your role might be called something else. 

I urge you to talk with your lead/manager or even with the human resources department to understand what are your own responsabilities and to understand your own _sphere of influence_ which encompasses what _you_ can shape in the company; and whose decisions you can influence directly - this most likely won't be clearly defined and will be highly shpaed by your personality and ambitions/aspirations.

## You've become a leader/manager now what?

### Firs steps

I would start with questioning - something that fundamentally changed me was fully embrace the concept of **perception is reality**.

Which in my _perception_ its really scary, what ever someone else perceives will be the thing that will shape his own reality! Just like seeing/smelling/etc.

To reduce the area of uncertainty and reduce the number of ways something can be perceived by someone (you are included in it!) I would start with questioning - mainly your line manager.

- Question your responsibilities:
  - What will drive your performance evaluation?
  - What are your line manager expectations?
  - What are your team expecations?
  - What's your job specification?
- Question/Ask for goals:
  - What should you achieve this year? (Quarterly even beter)
  - What's your team's goals for the year (quarterly)?
  - What's your company's goals for the year (quarterly)?
  - What's your team's vision?
  - What's the company's vision?
- Question/Ask about your IC's
  - Is there something you need to know before hand?
  - What personal goals did they commit to? Where are they written?
  - Are there any under-performers? over-performers?
  - Is there anyone key to the company?
  - Can you get access to their past performance reviews?

Now I would do a similar exercise with your IC's

- What are their expectations towards you?
- What are their current personal goals?
- What do they believe you need to know about them?
- What is going on well? 
- What needs to be changed?

### Perception is reality

Because perception IS NOT reality but it is really easiy to fall into that trap and assume that what you perceive is your own reality [10]
