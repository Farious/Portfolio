# Leadership

***

## Under-development // 17th May 2021

Welcome!

I'm FÃ¡bio and I've been leading teams for the past 5 years in the game development area - specifically - software developers.

This content is about showing tools that I've learned along my journey and that I would love to have known since my first days as a leader/manager.

I foresee that if you continue reading, at least one of the following will happen:

- You learn some new tools and add them to your toolbelt;
- You will notice that you've been using one of them successfully already, and afterwards you will do so more consciously;
- or, you won't agree with what I wrote, trigerring you to keep looking for your own path down the leadership role.

Everything that's written in this post is highly personal and portaits my own view/perspective and, above all, my own experience since I was promoted up until now.

## You've been promoted into a leadership position!

[Don't panic][12]

There will be so many unknowns in the first days, well even years, and if you have friends/colleagues that were promoted just now as well, I'd say that it is likely that your questions are the same as those of your own peers!

Feeling that other's questions were just like my own; or the common thought that I'm probably failing at something ("is there something trivial missing?"); or, that I might've overlooked something that ultimately lead to a constant feeling of uncertainty and even failure or inaptness - all of this triggered me to write this document, so that others won't feel the same or feel alone in it.

I had the good fortune of having really good leaders in my life, starting from my personal life up until my professional experience. 

One of those leaders was at Miniclip and it was him that helped me grow in this new position. First because he trully inspired me as a leader, making me follow him; and lastly, something that I used as my "clutch", it was something that he would answer whenever I questioned if I was really fit for the position: 

> If you were promoted to be a leader its because I trust in you and that you will do a great job at it. It wasn't mere chance.

## What do I consider to be leadership?

I'm going to start with something that might be polarizing - leadership/management is not about being a psychologist; being a profiller; guess other's inner motivations; etc

### Management vs Leadership

Both [management][1] and [leadership][2] are really well defined, as one can check on wikipedia.

Although I fear this is not the case when working in a business, where both terms might be used interchangeably and you might even end up putting both hats during the year.

I like to structure both definitions in such a way that I could explain it to one of my kids, almost in a ELI5 manner - so that I could use them as a compass:

- Manager - Approves vacations; time/project allocation of individuals; etc
- Leader - Grows/Empowers individuals to be better professionals; 
- IC - Individual contributor, the individuals that report to you;
- Line Manager - Your own leader/manager;
- Team - Everyone that works directly with you and, potentially, with your IC;
- HRBP - Human resource business partner, it's the person/team that directly interacts with you or your team.

Your current role might be more managerial or more leadership focused and, on top of that, it might even be called something else completely different.

## You've become a leader now what?

### Understand your role and responsibilities

It is important to fully understand your role and the expectations towards your results. Something that its trivial to do but easy to forget is to start with **questioning**.

To reduce the area of uncertainty about your role, as well as the number of ways something can be perceived by someone (you included!), I would start with questions - mainly directed at either your line manager and/or your HRBP.

- <details open><summary>Question your responsibilities:</summary>

    - What will drive your performance evaluation?
    - What are your line manager expectations?
    - What are your team expectations?
    - What is your job specification?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question your role:</summary>

    - Are you expected to be a fully dedicated leader/manager?
    - Are you expected to participate as a developer?
    - Do you have technical ownership over your team/project?
    - What's believed to be your _sphere of  influence_?
    - Who are your peers?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question your goals:</summary>

    - What should you achieve this year? (quarterly would be even better)
    - What are your team's goals for the year (quarterly)?
    - What are your company's goals for the year (quarterly)?
    - What is your team's vision?
    - What is the company's vision?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question about your team:</summary>

    - Is there something you need to know before hand?
    - What personal goals did they commit to? Where are they written?
    - Are there any under-performers? over-performers?
    - Who are the key individuals?
    - Can you get access to their past performance reviews?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question your promotion:</summary>

    - Why have you been promoted?
    - In your manager's perspective:
      - What are your strenghts?
      - What are your weaknesses?
    - ...
  </details>

Finally, it is important that you do a similar exercise with each individual of your team:

- What are their expectations towards you?
- What are their current personal goals?
- What do they believe you need to know about them?
- What is going on well? 
- What needs to be changed?
- ...

## Ten tools to have in your belt

### 1. Understanding that perception is reality

Reality may be more than what is being perceived by an individual, but it is easy to fall into that trap and assume that, indeed, what you perceive is reality \[[3]\].

I find this to be really scary, whatever someone else perceives will be perceived as being reality or shaping his own notion of it! 

Having this in consideration will help you better understand when others talk with you; identifying potential assumptions; questioning for their context, to understand their perspective; etc.

#### How it shaped my leadership

- Constantly trying to understand how my actions, or my teams', would be perceived by others;
- If someone reports me a situation I always _double click_ to get to the facts;
- I never assume that someone might be lying, at most its their incomplete percepetion of the facts shaping their

#### Example

    You agree with your _line manager_ to take some time-off today and that you will make it later tonight.
    
    Your _individual contributor_ sees you working at 00h15, e.g. a commit timestamp.
    - Will he know that you agreed with your lead?
    - Will he think that you did overtime?
    - Will that positevely re-inforce that its ok to work after-hours?
    - And your peers? Will they think that you are trying to over-achieve?
    - How will that shape their relationship with you or with the company?

### 2. Double clicking \\STUB

When browsing through your file system on Windows it is normal to *double click* folders to understand what they may contain.
This section is about having a similar approach when talking with others.

If someone says something to you in a conversation its because it matters either to the person or to the conversation, although sometimes it might not even be a conscious decision though.

By double clicking you will get a deeper insight into the conversation, helping you be engaged with the person and with the conversation - even if you are not and if we remember the #1 tool, you will appear to be doing it.
Getting a deeper insight will allow you to more easily extract the relevant data and/or help take more informed decisions, which can only be good.

#### How it shaped my leadership

The more I had one-on-one's with my IC's the better I knew them, which helped me understand what "keywords" they used that would have a whole thread of conversation that would benefit both. 
So I uncousciously picked them up, sometimes, and went deeper with meaningful conversations.

When I learned about double clicking was when it got from uncouscious into a conscious decision! Helped me pick up way more relevant data from my conversations.

This shaped my leadership but the way I talk with my family as well.

#### Example

    A: Even though I'm not proficient I moved to closer-to-the-metal languages as it allowed for better memory tracking issues. 
    B.1: What type of memory problems were you having?
    B.2: Was there a better approach that you could've taken?
    B.3: What makes you say you are not proficient?

### 3. Active listening \\STUB

In a two-sided conversation you need to listen and talk! You can't be thinking in what you did for lunch yesterday or what to say next; OR what they will be saying next! You need to listen and show that you are listening.

Active listening is about showing to the other that you are listening and, ensuring that you are engaged in the conversation.

If not, does it make sense to be having one?
All about \[[11]\].

### 4. Sphere of influence \\STUB

_sphere of influence_ which encompasses what _you_ can shape in the company; whose decisions you can influence directly - don't expect this to be clearly defined and it will be highly shaped by your personality and ambitions/aspirations.

### 5. Juggling Koan \\STUB

You are juggling tasks and responsibilities until they feel easy and light, now you can take on bigger ones. What do you do? - You pass those small balls to your _IC_'s that are interested in them! They won't have the same size for them, as they had for you, and you will be free to take one more.

Sometimes its ok to let one of them drop to the floor.

All about \[[13]\].

### 6. Relationship bank account \\STUB

Every action can be seen as a withdraw or a deposit. Do you have a positive balance?

### ... \\STUB

### Leading someone that you were already close with \\STUB

### Leading someone that is becoming now a friend \\STUB

### You have someone in probation what do do?!? \\STUB

### Underperfomers? What now? \\STUB

### Being you - a human \\STUB
