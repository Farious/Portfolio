# Leadership

## Under-development // 10th July 2021

    STUB sections marks sections still in development

***

Welcome!

I'm FÃ¡bio and I've been leading teams for the past 5 years in the game development area - specifically - software developers.

This content is about showing tools that I've learned along my journey and that I would love to have known since my first days as a leader/manager.

I foresee that if you continue reading, at least one of the following will happen:

- You learn some new tools and add them to your toolbelt;
- You will notice that you've been using one of them successfully already, and afterwards you will do so more consciously;
- or, you won't agree with what I wrote, trigerring you to keep looking for your own path down the leadership role.

Everything that's written in this post is highly personal and portaits my own view/perspective and, above all, my own experience since I was promoted up until now.

## You've been promoted into a leadership position!

[Don't panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic)

There will be so many unknowns in the first days, well even years, and if you have friends/colleagues that were promoted just now as well, I'd say that it is likely that your questions are the same as those of your own peers!

Feeling that other's questions were just like my own; or the common thought that I'm probably failing at something ("is there something trivial missing?"); or, that I might've overlooked something that ultimately lead to a constant feeling of uncertainty and even failure or inaptness - all of this triggered me to write this document, so that others won't feel the same or feel alone in it.

I had the good fortune of having really good leaders in my life, starting from my personal life up until my professional experience. 

One of those leaders was at Miniclip and it was him that helped me grow in this new position. First because he trully inspired me as a leader, making me follow him; and lastly, something that I used as my "clutch", it was something that he would answer whenever I questioned if I was really fit for the position: 

> If you were promoted to be a leader its because I trust in you and that you will do a great job at it. It wasn't mere chance.

## What do I consider to be leadership?

I'm going to start with something that might be polarizing - leadership/management is not about being a psychologist; being a profiller; guess other's inner motivations; etc

### Management vs Leadership

Both [management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management) and [leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) are really well defined, as one can check on wikipedia.

Although I fear this is not the case when working in a business, where both terms might be used interchangeably and you might even end up putting both hats during the year.

I like to structure both definitions in such a way that I could explain it to one of my kids, almost in a ELI5 manner - so that I could use them as a compass:

- Manager - Approves vacations; time/project allocation of individuals; etc
- Leader - Grows/Empowers individuals to be better professionals; 
- IC - Individual contributor, the individuals that report to you;
- Line Manager - Your own leader/manager;
- Team - Everyone that works directly with you and, potentially, with your IC;
- HRBP - Human resource business partner, it's the person/team that directly interacts with you or your team.

Your current role might be more managerial or more leadership focused and, on top of that, it might even be called something else completely different.

## You've become a leader now what?

### Understand your role and responsibilities

It is important to fully understand your role and the expectations towards your results. Something that its trivial to do but easy to forget is to start with **questioning**.

To reduce the area of uncertainty about your role, as well as the number of ways something can be perceived by someone (you included!), I would start with questions - mainly directed at either your line manager and/or your HRBP.

- <details open><summary>Question your responsibilities:</summary>

    - What will drive your performance evaluation?
    - What are your line manager expectations?
    - What are your team expectations?
    - What is your job specification?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question your role:</summary>

    - Are you expected to be a fully dedicated leader/manager?
    - Are you expected to participate as a developer?
    - Do you have technical ownership over your team/project?
    - What's believed to be your _sphere of  influence_?
    - Who are your peers?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question your goals:</summary>

    - What should you achieve this year? (quarterly would be even better)
    - What are your team's goals for the year (quarterly)?
    - What are your company's goals for the year (quarterly)?
    - What is your team's vision?
    - What is the company's vision?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question about your team:</summary>

    - Is there something you need to know before hand?
    - What personal goals did they commit to? Where are they written?
    - Are there any under-performers? over-performers?
    - Who are the key individuals?
    - Can you get access to their past performance reviews?
    - ...
  </details>

- <details open><summary>Question your promotion:</summary>

    - Why have you been promoted?
    - In your manager's perspective:
      - What are your strenghts?
      - What are your weaknesses?
    - ...
  </details>

Finally, it is important that you do a similar exercise with each individual of your team:

- What are their expectations towards you?
- What are their current personal goals?
- What do they believe you need to know about them?
- What is going on well? 
- What needs to be changed?
- ...

## Ten tools to have in your belt

### 1. Understanding that perception is reality

Reality may be more than what is being perceived by an individual, but it is easy to fall into that trap and assume that, indeed, what you perceive is reality \[[Perception is not reality @ Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-power-prime/201908/perception-is-not-reality)\].

I find this to be really scary, whatever someone else perceives will be perceived as being reality or shaping his own notion of it! 

Having this in consideration will help you better understand when others talk with you; identifying potential assumptions; questioning for their context, to understand their perspective; etc.

#### How it shaped my leadership

- Constantly trying to understand how my actions, or my teams', would be perceived by others;
- If someone reports me a situation I always _double click_ to get to the facts;
- I never assume that someone might be lying, most times its their incomplete percepetion of the situation that shapes what they believe are facts.

#### Example

    You agree with your _line manager_ to take some time-off today and that you will make it later tonight.
    
    Your _individual contributor_ sees you working at 00h15, e.g. a commit timestamp.
    - Will he know that you agreed with your lead?
    - Will he think that you did overtime?
    - Will that positevely re-inforce that its ok to work after-hours?
    - And your peers? Will they think that you are trying to over-achieve?
    - How will that shape their relationship with you or with the company?

### 2. Double clicking

When browsing through your file system on Windows its normal to *double click* folders to understand what they may contain.
This section is about having a similar approach when talking with others.

If someone says something to you in a conversation its because it may matter either to the person or to the conversation (or both).

By *double clicking* you will get a deeper insight into the conversation, helping you be engaged with the person and with the conversation - even if you are not, but perception will most likely be that you are.
Getting a deeper insight will allow you to more easily extract the relevant data and/or help take more informed decisions, which can only be positive.

#### How it shaped my leadership

The more I had one-on-one's with my IC's the better I knew them, which helped me understand what "keywords" they used that would have a whole thread of conversation that would benefit both. 
So, sometimes, I would uncousciously picked them up and went deeper with meaningful conversations.

When I learned about double clicking was when it got from uncouscious into a conscious decision! Helped me pick up way more relevant data from my conversations.

This shaped not only my leadership but the way I talk with any other person.

#### Example

    A: Even though I'm not proficient I moved to closer-to-the-metal languages as it allowed for better memory tracking issues.
    Potential questions:
    B.1: What type of memory problems were you having?
    B.2: Was there a better approach that you could've taken?
    B.3: What makes you say you are not proficient?

### 3. Active listening

*Active listening* is about showing others that you are *listening* and, ensuring that you are engaged in the conversation. Focusing on what they are saying and avoiding: thinking what to say next; thinking what they will say next; thinking about something else; etc.

If not, does it make sense to be having one?

The key here is: listen!

- step 1: Listen;
- step 2: keep listening;
- step 3: Stop thinking and listen!

When it comes to your reply there are multiple approaches here, but they all focus on giving confirmation that you listened:

- Incorporating parts of what they said in your response;
- Resuming what others said, before you continue with your response;
- Double-clicking;
- Silent noding or vocalized confirmation: "I see"; "hmm"; etc.
- etc

Find more with \[[Active listening @ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening)\].

#### How it shaped my leadership

I'm still terrible at listening, as I often get lost in my thoughts, e.g. thinking about what I really want to say next; to give out the answer; etc.

This tool helped me by understand that listening is much more than just hearing others talk.

- When having One-on-one's with my IC's I would get distracted, but if I had that momemt of clarity that I was getting distracted, I would go immediatly into active listening and would employ double-click (most times I would even acknowledge to them that I got distracted);
- I use silent confirmation ("hmm hmm"), but its so automatic that I'm really not that engaged! After learning about this I tried to make them an automatic trigger to change my own posture while in a converstation: e.g. "Here I am hmm-hmm'ing again";
- I really liked the double-click analogy as, one of my responsibilities as a leader was to surface potential problems and improvements to better enable my team, so this clearly "clicked" into that.

### 4. Open/Closed Biased/Unbiased questions \\STUB

There are several distinct ways that you can ask a question, the way you do them will:

- define the answer you get;
- the shape of the conversation from that point onwards;
- the relationship with the person.

This tools is about being mindful about how a question can drive a conversation. 

- Open vs Closed - Evaluates if a question is prone to a open answer or a short\closed answer.
- Biased vs Unbiased - Evaluates if you are adding your opinion as means to lead the answer towards your opinion.

#### How it shaped my leadership

This tool greatly helped me when preparing for interviews and conducting them. I would project my experience and personality into what the candidate would answer or think about something - assumptions!.

With this tool I would always evaluate each questions that I posed if they were going to be open or closed, or if I was being biased towards some answer.

The outcome of this would be that I would have:

- More meaningful conversations;
- More valuable answers (less follow-up questions);
- Less personal interpretations - less assumptions - on what others think\said;

#### Example

- Biased - "Was that the wrong approach?"
- Closed - "Did you like the presentation?"
- Unbiased Open - "What were your takeaways from the presentation?"

### 5. Relationship bank account \\STUB

Every action can be seen as a withdraw or a deposit. Do you have a positive balance?

### 6. Sphere of influence

The _sphere of influence_ is everything which encompasses what _you_ can shape within the company: whose decisions you can influence directly.

This is really hard to define and so don't expect this to be clearly defined, and more importantly it will be shaped by your personality and ambitions/aspirations. People and teams will enter and exit the sphere with time and even depending on the context.

It is important to notice that such a sphere exists and to take it into consideration when making decisions.

#### How it shaped my leadership

There are people that I naturally feel more aligned or more "at ease", or where I could get their honest opinion.
I would see these people as having me in their sphere of influence, I would let me be influenced by them as they would help me make better decisions and would also help me "unbias" my own thoughts.

I believe I built bridges with some people and teams based on my expertise in some technical topics, I would take advantage of that to be closer to those people/teams. This would give me a better insight on tensions\problems\etc from other teams and even on my own.

### 7. Juggling Koan \\STUB

You are juggling tasks and responsibilities until they feel easy and light, now you can take on bigger ones. What do you do? - You pass those small balls to your _IC_'s that are interested in them! They won't have the same size for them, as they had for you, and you will be free to take one more.

Sometimes its ok to let one of them drop to the floor.
