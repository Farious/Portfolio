# Leadership

## Under-development // 26th April 2021

Welcome!

I'm FÃ¡bio and I've been leading teams for the past 5 years in the game development area - specifically - software developers.

This content is about showing tools that I've learned along my journey and that I would love to have known since my first days as a leader/manager.

I foresee that if you continue reading, at least one of the following will happen:

- You learn some new tools and add them to your toolbelt;
- You will notice that you've been using one of them successfully already, and afterwards you will do so more consciously;
- or, you won't agree with what I wrote, trigerring you to keep looking for your own path down the leadership role.

Everything that's written in this post is highly personal and portaits my own view/perspective and, above all, my own experience since I was promoted up until now.

## You've been promoted into a leadership position!

[Don't panic][100]

There will be so many unknowns in the first days, well even years, and if you have friends/colleagues that were promoted just now as well, I'd say that it is likely that your questions are the same as those of your own peers!

Feeling that other's questions were just like my own; or the common thought that I'm probably failing at something ("is there something trivial missing?"); or, that I might've overlooked something that ultimately lead to a constant feeling of uncertainty and even failure or inaptness - all of this triggered me to write this document, so that others won't feel the same or feel alone in it.

I had the good fortune of having really good leaders in my life, starting from my personal life up until my professional experience. 

One of those leaders was at Miniclip and it was him that helped me grow in this new position. First because he trully inspired me as a leader, making me follow him; and lastly, something that I used as my "clutch", it was something that he would answer whenever I questioned if I was really fit for the position: 

    If you were promoted to be a leader its because I trust in you and that you will do a great job at it. It wasn't mere chance.

## What do I consider to be leadership?

I'm going to start with something that might be polarizing - leadership/management is not about being a psychologist; being a profiller; guess other's inner motivations; etc

### Management vs Leadership

Both [management][1] and [leadership][2] are really well defined, as one can check on wikipedia.

Although I fear this is not the case when working in a business, where both terms might be used interchangeably and you might even end up putting both hats during the year.

I like to structure both definitions in such a way that I could explain it to one of my kids, almost in a ELI5 manner - so that I could use them as a compass:

- Manager - Approves vacations; time/project allocation of individuals; etc
- Leader - Grows/Empowers individuals to be better professionals; 
- IC - Individual contributor, the individuals that report to you;
- Line Manager - Your own leader/manager;
- Team - Everyone that works directly with you and, potentially, with your IC;
- HRBP - Human resource business partner, it's the person/team that directly interacts with you or your team.

Your current role might be more managerial or more leadership focused and, on top of that, it might even be called something else completely different.

## You've become a leader/manager now what?

### First step

I would start with *questioning* - something that fundamentally changed me was fully embracing the concept of **perception is reality**.

Which in my _perception_ its really scary, whatever someone else perceives will be perceived as being reality or shaping his own notion of it! 

  Ex.1. If your IC sees you working at 00h15 (a commit with that timestamp) will he know that you agreed to take sometime off with your line manager during the day for some personal matters? and your peers? How will that shape their relationship with you or with the company?

To reduce the area of uncertainty as well as the number of ways something can be perceived by someone (you included!) I would start with questioning - mainly questioning your line manager and your HRBP.

- Question your responsibilities:
  - What will drive your performance evaluation?
  - What are your line manager expectations?
  - What are your team expectations?
  - What's your job specification?
- Question your role:
  - Are you expected to be a fully dedicated leader/manager?
  - Are you expected to participate as a developer?
  - Do you have technical ownership over your team/project?
  - What's believed to be your _sphere of  influence_?
- Ask for goals:
  - What should you achieve this year? (Quarterly even beter)
  - What's your team's goals for the year (quarterly)?
  - What's your company's goals for the year (quarterly)?
  - What's your team's vision?
  - What's the company's vision?
- Ask about your IC's:
  - Is there something you need to know before hand?
  - What personal goals did they commit to? Where are they written?
  - Are there any under-performers? over-performers?
  - Is there anyone key to the company?
  - Can you get access to their past performance reviews?
- Ask about your promotion:
  - Why have you been promoted?
  - What are your strenghts?
  - What are your weaknesses? 

Now I would do a similar exercise with your IC's

- What are their expectations towards you?
- What are their current personal goals?
- What do they believe you need to know about them?
- What is going on well? 
- What needs to be changed?

## Top 10 tips

### Perception is reality \\STUB

Because perception IS NOT reality but it is really easiy to fall into that trap and assume that what you perceive is your own reality [10]

### Sphere of influence

_sphere of influence_ which encompasses what _you_ can shape in the company; whose decisions you can influence directly - don't expect this to be clearly defined and it will be highly shaped by your personality and ambitions/aspirations.

### Active listening \\STUB

All about [20].

### ... \\STUB

### Leading someone that you were already close with

### Leading someone that is becoming now a friend

### You have someone in probation what do do?!?

### Underperfomers? what now?
