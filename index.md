# FÃ¡bio Reis's simple portefolio

This page will act as a simple online portefolio for my public game development endeaveurs.

## Simple Engine

A simple engine, not so simple architecture due to lack of expertise, that works as a learning process around real-time rendering and game engine architecture. Being made with C++; SDL2.0 and OpenGL Core.

## Centauri Rising

Continued work from Forsaken Void, where I've been highly focused in the movement system. The system is controlled via thrusters that each force is applied either in a manual manner or trying to follow a target/spline, this second approach uses PID controllers implemented by me to stabilise the spaceship. A game being made with two childhood friends.

## Forsaken Void

A space simulation game inspired by FTL with an higher focus on exploration. Started as a unity project which then was migrated to unreal engine 4 due to some technical limitation on the free version of Unity3D. A game being made with two childhood friends.

## Blockimals

A match-3 game that was born from my Ores clone in C++, it evolved still in the C++ codebase, but was then ported to Unity to have a better UI development flow. The idea was to use this project as fund raising for animal shelters. A game made with two childhood friends.

## Ores clone

A ores clone used to learn SDL 2.0. Made using C++ (a lot of autos) and SDL2.0

## Treelema

A game for the LudumDare #38, Theme: A Small World, heavily inspired by **Bastion**. Made in Unity3D in around 6h. A game made with two childhood friends

## Elon Musk Simulator

A game for the LudumDare #43, Theme: Sacrifices must be made, a game where you sacrifice your crew members as weapons. Made in Unreal Engine in around 8h. A game made with two childhood friends
