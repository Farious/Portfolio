Narration Script (Djani, from the afterlife)
[Voice: deep, trembling, intimate. Slow pace, like remembering and confessing.]

(Soft, almost a whisper.)

Djani… a mother of one.
Once, I was held in the small arms of my child… and there, in that fragile embrace… I slipped into the spice trance.

In that vision, the desert opened before me.
I walked out into the dunes, searching for the sea of Caladan…
…hoping to carve a better future… for the water of my own water.

(Slight pause. Let a low breath tremble through the next lines.)

I heard waves… or thought I did.
Waves that rattled like sand in a storm.
Drawn by that sound, I went deeper… and deeper… into the desert.

I swam through an ocean only I could feel…
following the footsteps taught by my ancestors,
mazing through Arrakis,
guided by the low, rattling hum…
and the dark blue hue of my own eyes.

(Longer pause.)

The moons came…
…and went.

My body grew fragile with hunger… with thirst.
I had left my sietch with no food…
no water for two.
Yet somehow, I found a hidden spring,
a source of water that kept me afloat
in the endless ocean of Arrakis.

(Voice rougher, slower.)

The moons came…
…and went.

The water source… was spent.
Dried.
Gone.

My search for the sea faltered…
as the rattling sands I heard
gave way to something else.

(Drop to a very soft, breaking tone.)

A feeling.

The feeling… of loss.

The loss of what I had held most dear…
the loss of what had been closest to my heart.
A longing so sharp it almost spoke…
but I could not understand it.
Not yet.

(Gradually steadying, as if clarity arrives.)

As my eyes cleared…
the sound of the sea vanished.
The waves I thought I heard
became only sand…
pushed and reshaped
by the cold desert wind.

Then I saw it.

I saw… what no words can truly hold.

In this vast ocean of feeling,
the sand drank my water…
as I gave it all.

(Let this next part be very quiet, almost like a prayer.)

Where once two had embraced,
hoping for some shared future…

now there were only bones,
wandering with the dunes,
turning… drifting…
through the sands.

Bones, waiting to be taken in…
by the desert…
by the stories whispered across its face…
by the mercy of forgetting…
or… perhaps…
by forgiveness.

(Fade out on “forgiveness,” with a long exhale.)
