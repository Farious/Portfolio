<!-- # Tools to have in your belt

This will be a series of posts covering tools that I would like to have known since my first day as a leader.

# 2. Double clicking -->

When browsing through your file system on Windows its normal to *double click* folders to understand what they may contain.
This section is about having a similar approach when talking with others.

If someone says something to you in a conversation its because it may matter either to the person or to the conversation (or both).

By *double clicking* you will get a deeper insight into the conversation, helping you be engaged with the person and with the conversation - even if you are not, but perception will most likely be that you are.
Getting a deeper insight will allow you to more easily extract the relevant data and/or help take more informed decisions, which can only be positive.

## How it shaped my leadership

The more I had one-on-one's with my IC's the better I knew them, which helped me understand when some words were actually "keywords" and, thus, could be unfolded into a whole thread of conversation benefiting both.

So, sometimes, I would pick them subconsciously and use them to help me communicate better and go deeper into meaningful conversations.

When I learned about double clicking was when it got from unconscious into a conscious decision! Helped me pick up way more relevant data from my conversations.

This shaped not only my leadership but the way I talk with any other person.

## Example

> A: Even though I'm not proficient I moved to closer-to-the-metal languages as it allowed for better memory tracking issues.

> Potential questions:

> - B.1: What type of memory problems were you having?
> - B.2: Was there a better approach that you could've taken?
> - B.3: What makes you say you are not proficient?
